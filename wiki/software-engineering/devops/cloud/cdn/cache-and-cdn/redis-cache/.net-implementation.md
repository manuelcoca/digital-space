## Creating a connection

```csharp
using StackExchange.Redis;
...
var connectionString = "[cache-name].redis.cache.windows.net:6380,password=[password-here],ssl=True,abortConnect=False";
var redisConnection = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(connectionString);
```

## Accessing a Redis database <a href="#accessing-a-redis-database" id="accessing-a-redis-database"></a>

```csharp
IDatabase db = redisConnection.GetDatabase();
bool wasSet = db.StringSet("favorite:flavor", "i-love-rocky-road");
string value = db.StringGet("favorite:flavor");
Console.WriteLine(value); // displays: ""i-love-rocky-road""
```

## Executing other commands <a href="#executing-other-commands" id="executing-other-commands"></a>

```csharp
var result = db.Execute("ping");
Console.WriteLine(result.ToString()); // displays: "PONG"

var result = await db.ExecuteAsync("client", "list");
Console.WriteLine($"Type = {result.Type}\r\nResult = {result}");
```

## Other common operations <a href="#other-common-operations" id="other-common-operations"></a>

The `IDatabase` interface includes several other methods to work with the Redis cache. There are methods to work with hashes, lists, sets, and ordered sets.

Here are some of the more common ones that work with single keys, you can [read the source code](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis/blob/master/src/StackExchange.Redis/Interfaces/IDatabase.cs) for the interface to see the full list.

| Method              | Description                                                                                                                                               |

| `CreateBatch`       | Creates a group of operations that will be sent to the server as a single unit, but not necessarily processed as a unit.                                  |
| `CreateTransaction` | Creates a group of operations that will be sent to the server as a single unit and processed on the server as a single unit.                              |
| `KeyDelete`         | Delete the key/value.                                                                                                                                     |
| `KeyExists`         | Returns whether the given key exists in cache.                                                                                                            |
| `KeyExpire`         | Sets a time-to-live (TTL) expiration on a key.                                                                                                            |
