It is important to secure the access to the Kubernetes Cluster and `kube-apiserver`.

-   Who can access? (Authentification)
-   What can they do? (Authorization)
-   Kubernetes components communication between each other is TLS encrypted
-   Communication between applications within the cluster can be secured with Network Policies. By default they can all communicate to each other
