With RBAC its possible to restrict access to api-resources. For advanced restrictions like:

-   Check yaml configuration on creating Pods an don't allow images from unkown private registries
-   Don't allow to run containers as root user
-   Don't allow specific image versions
-   Enforce yaml configs to always have metadata specified

Admission Controllers can be used.
