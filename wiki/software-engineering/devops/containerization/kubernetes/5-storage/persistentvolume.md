PersistentVolume object helps to manage storage more centrally. In a big cluster with many pods, it would be hard to manage the volumes in all Pods since a change would require to modify multiple pod definition files.

A PersistenVolume is a cluster wide pool of storage volumes managed by the administrator. Users then can select storage from the pool with [PersistenVolumeClaims](persistentvolumeclaim.md).

-   Have a lifecycle independent of any individual pod
-   You can define Reclaiming options to decide what should happen, if a Pod gets killed
    -   Retain
    -   Delete

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
    name: pv0003
spec:
    capacity:
        storage: 5Gi # Amount of storage that should be reserved for this PersistenVolume
    volumeMode: Filesystem
    accessModes: # How a volume should be mounted on the hosts, whether in a read-only mode or read/write mode
        - ReadWriteOnce
    persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete # Decides what should happen if a PersistenVolumeClaim is delete. In this case volume will be deleted as well.
    storageClassName: slow
    nfs: # Volume type
        path: /tmp
        server: 172.17.0.2
```
