1. Challenges in Managing Containers and Distributed Applications:
    1. Managing containers at scale and architecting distributed applications based on microservices' principles is challenging.
2. Requirements for Container Management:
    1. Continuous integration pipeline is needed to build, test, and verify container images.
    2. A cluster of machines serves as the base infrastructure for running containers.
    3. A system is required to launch containers and monitor them for failures and self-healing.
    4. Rolling updates, rollbacks, and resource teardown capabilities are necessary.
3. Network and Storage Considerations:
    1. Flexible, scalable, and easy-to-manage network and storage solutions are crucial.
    2. Containers launched on worker nodes need to be connected to other containers securely.
    3. Storage structure should provide seamless storage provisioning, retention, or recycling.
