-   Deploying containers and using Kubernetes requires a different approach to application deployment and system administration compared to traditional methods.
-   Kubernetes deploys numerous small web servers (microservices) instead of a single large server, allowing for scalability and flexibility.
-   Microservices are transient and decoupled, replacing different aspects of traditional applications.
-   Services and API calls connect and manage communication between microservices.
-   Developers need to understand that Kubernetes is not just a virtual machine manager and may require rewriting legacy applications for optimal cloud performance.
