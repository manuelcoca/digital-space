## Challenges with Manual Container Management

-   Single container instances can't handle increasing load
-   Manual deployment and tracking of multiple instances is difficult
-   Container/host crashes require manual intervention
-   Managing thousands of containers by hand is impossible

## Benefits of Orchestration

-   Distributes containers across multiple hosts for fault tolerance
-   Automatically scales container instances based on load
-   Provides advanced networking between instances
-   Popular solutions include Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and others
