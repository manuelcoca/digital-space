# Proxy Server

Proxy servers are intermediary servers that can manage traffic between any two communication endpoints (e.g client and server).

### Different Proxy Servers Use-Cases

**Forward Proxy**

-   **What It Does:** Acts as a middleman on behalf of the user's device.
-   **Difference:** Reverse proxies protect the server side, whereas forward proxy protects client side.
-   **Use-Cases:** Privacy, accessing blocked sites, and browser caching.

**Reverse Proxy**

-   **What It Does:** Acts as a middleman for the server's responses to clients.
-   **Difference:** Forward proxies protect client side, whereas reverse proxies protect and improve server side performance.
-   **Use-Cases:** Server load balancing, security enhancements, and adding server-side features.

**Transparent Proxy**

-   **What It Does:** Intercepts internet traffic without the user's knowledge or configuration.
-   **Difference:** Unlike forward or reverse proxies, it's invisible to users.
-   **Use-Cases:** Content filtering, performance via caching, and traffic monitoring.

**HTTP/S Proxy**

-   **What It Does:** Forwards internet requests without or with encryption.
-   **Use-Cases:** Accessing HTTP content, secure browsing with HTTPS, bypassing SSL-based geo-restrictions

**Static Proxy**

-   **What It Does:** Forwards request with a consistent IP address.
-   **Use-Cases:** When a fixed IP is needed for consistent access to applications or services.

**DNS Proxy**

-   **What It Does:** Manages DNS requests.
-   **Use-Cases:** Bypassing DNS-based censorship, speeding up DNS queries.

**Anonymous Proxy**

-   **What It Does:** Hides IP address and adds security features.
-   **Use-Cases:** Privacy, accessing censored content, adding encryption, and data scraping without revealing your IP.
-   **Example:** Tor Onion Proxy

**SEO Proxy**

-   **What It Does:** Helps with SEO by simulating different geographic locations or user profiles.
-   **Use-Cases:** SEO analysis, rank checking from different locations, or SEO tool usage.
