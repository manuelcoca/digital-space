The formal foundation of the field of AI research was laid in 1956 during a workshop at Dartmouth College. Key milestones include:

-   1950s - 1970s: Early excitement, marked by the development of basic algorithms and the demonstration of the potential of AI.
-   1980s - 1990s: The rise of machine learning, with computers being able to learn from and adapt to new data without being explicitly programmed.
-   2000s - Present: The era of big data and deep learning, leading to significant advancements and the integration of AI in everyday technology.

# Early AI Algorithms

The inception of AI saw the development of algorithms designed to solve problems and mimic human intelligence. Some of the first and most influential algorithms include:

-   Logic Theorist (1955-56): Often considered the first artificial intelligence program, created by Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon, and Cliff Shaw. It was capable of proving mathematical theorems.
-   ELIZA (1966): Created by Joseph Weizenbaum, this early natural language processing program could mimic conversation by matching user prompts to scripted responses.
-   Perceptron (1957): Developed by Frank Rosenblatt, this was an early neural network, a foundational algorithm for what would evolve into deep learning. It was designed for pattern recognition through supervised learning.
