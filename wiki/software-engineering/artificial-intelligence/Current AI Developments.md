-   Elon Musk predicts, that AI Chips will be implemented in human bodies

# LAM - Large Action Models

-   Current LLMs are good in understanding someones intention, but not in executing tasks reliable end-to-end
-   LAMs are able to understand and execute human intentions based on prompts. LAMs utilizes LLMs to understand human intentions and a blend of transformer-style attention, graph-based message passing, and program synthesizers, which are guided by demonstrations and examples, to learn interface navigation and task execution in various domains

### Latest LAM developments

-   Rabbit Research is a Startup building LAM model integrated into a mobile device (R1) able to understand and execute several tasks

# Microsoft AI News

-   Copilot Pro launched and it's better than ChatGPT and Gemini. Copilot Pro can be used in PowerPoint, Excel, Word, Outlook and Teams. It also allows to create custom copilots for specific tasks.
-   Azure OpenAI Service introduced DALL-E 3, which brings improved image quality and complex scene generation.
-   DALL-E 3 comes with expanded configurability for content filtering and introduces new Responsible AI (RAI) models to detect jaulbreaks
-   Azure AI Studio aims to become the one-stop solution for building generative AI applications. It's a central hub for accessing rich feature sets and different models from OpenAI, NVIDIA, Meta e.g GPT4 and Llama.

# General AI News

-   Google will launch VLOGGER mid April. It can turn images into videos, translate videos in real time and edit videos.
-   Open-source software engineering agent, based on ChatGPT 4, with a 12.3% resolve rate. Almost as good as Devin with 13%.
    -   https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent
-   Microsoft and OpenAI are planning project "Stargate" — a $100 billion data center project.
-   Stanford researchers just introduced Octopus v2, a new framework for on-device AI agents.
-   Apple introduced ReALM, a new AI system that can understand on-screen tasks and background processes
    -   This will make other Apple Services like Siri smarter at understanding your screen
-   Apple exploring home robots
-   Stability revea
-   Researchers at Anthropic discovered a new way to jailbreak AI models by feeding them multiple fake conversations
    -   The vulnerability in AI models comes from their ability to learn from long inputs.![[GKU_jXoaEAAG_bb.png]]
-   Meta released Garment3DGen - A way to convert images of clothes into 3D models which can be used in VR

# Limits & Concerns

-   LLMs like GPT are trained on large amount of data. At some point the model can‘t be scaled anymore so current developments focus on learning more in less data and being able to process more data.
-   There is no transparency. What data is used to train the models? How is the data trained etc.? Before using AI, we should think about that
