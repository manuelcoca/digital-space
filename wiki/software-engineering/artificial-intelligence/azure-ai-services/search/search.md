All organizations rely on information to make decisions, answer questions, and function efficiently. The problem for most organizations is not a lack of information, but the challenge of finding and extracting the information from the massive set of documents, databases, and other sources in which the information is stored.

Azure Cognitive Search provides a cloud-based solution for indexing and querying a wide range of data sources, and creating comprehensive and high-scale search solutions. With Azure Cognitive Search, you can:

-   Index documents and data from a range of sources.
-   Use cognitive skills to enrich index data with custom or AI functions.
-   Store extracted insights in a knowledge store for analysis and integration.
