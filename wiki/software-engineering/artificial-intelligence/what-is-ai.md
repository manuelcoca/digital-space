Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI characteristics and human-like capabilities:

1. **Visual perception** - Interpret, and process input from images, video streams, and live cameras.
2. **Text analysis** - Use *natural language processing (NLP)* to "read" and extract semantic meaning from text-based data.
3. **Speech** - Recognize speech as input and synthesize spoken output. The combination of speech capabilities together with the ability to apply NLP analysis of text enables a form of human-compute interaction that's become known as *conversational AI*, in which users can interact with AI agents (usually referred to as *bots*) in much the same way they would with another human.
4. **Decision making** - The ability to use past experience and learned correlations to assess situations and take appropriate actions.
5. **Problem Solving** - Solve e.g mathematical problems
6. **Creativity** - Generative AI can simulate human-like creativity by generating Text, Images, Video, Code and more.

AI can be categorized into two main types:

-   **Narrow/Weak AI** - Also known as Weak AI, focuses on one narrow task. Most AI used in our daily lives, from search engines to voice assistants, falls under this category.
-   **General/Strong AI** - Also known as Strong AI, this refers to systems or machines that possess the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human being can. It is self-aware and could even develop emotions. General/Strong AI remains a largely theoretical concept at present.
