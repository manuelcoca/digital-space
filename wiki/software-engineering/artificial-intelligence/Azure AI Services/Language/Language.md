Every day, the world generates a vast quantity of data; much of it text-based in the form of emails, social media posts, online reviews, business documents, and more. Artificial intelligence techniques that apply statistical and semantic models enable you to create applications that extract meaning and insights from this text-based data.

To use the Azure AI Language service to analyze text, you must provision a resource for it in your Azure subscription. You can provision a single-service **Azure AI Language** resource, or you can use a multi-service **Azure AI Services** resource.

The Azure AI Language Service provides an REST API and SDKs for following text analysis features which fall into two categories:

# Pre-configured Features

| Summarization                                                                                                                                                        | Summarization is available for both documents and conversations, and will summarize the text into key sentences that are predicted to encapsulate the input's meaning.                                                                                         |
| [Name entity recognition](/o/dG9lU0KHIdHcxa94EY4e/s/P6fNNGB9iCrfE7Zsn3eW/azure-ai-services/language-service/pre-configured-features/named-entity-recognition)        | Extract and identify entities, such as people, places, or companies, allowing your app to recognize different types of entities. Example: The waterfront pier is my favorite Seattle attraction", *Seattle* would be identified and categorized as a location. |
| [Key phrase extraction](/o/dG9lU0KHIdHcxa94EY4e/s/P6fNNGB9iCrfE7Zsn3eW/azure-ai-services/language-service/pre-configured-features/extract-key-phrases)               | Identifying important words and phrases in the text that indicate the main points. Example: "Text Analytics is one of the features in Azure AI Services.", the service would extract *"Azure AI Services"* and *"Text Analytics"*.                             |
| [Sentiment analysis](/o/dG9lU0KHIdHcxa94EY4e/s/P6fNNGB9iCrfE7Zsn3eW/azure-ai-services/language-service/pre-configured-features/analyse-sentiment)                    | Identifies how positive or negative a string or document is. Example: "Great hotel. Close to plenty of food and attractions we could walk to", the service would identify that as *positive* with a relatively high confidence score.                          |
| [Language detection](/o/dG9lU0KHIdHcxa94EY4e/s/P6fNNGB9iCrfE7Zsn3eW/azure-ai-services/language-service/pre-configured-features/detect-language)                      | Determining the language in which text is written.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

# Learned Features

Learned features require building and training a model to correctly predict appropriate labels:

| C[onversational language understanding (CLU)](/o/dG9lU0KHIdHcxa94EY4e/s/P6fNNGB9iCrfE7Zsn3eW/azure-ai-services/language-service/model-based-features-learning/conversational-language-understanding-clu) | CLU is one of the core custom features offered by Azure AI Language. CLU helps users to build custom natural language understanding models to predict overall intent and extract important information from incoming utterances. CLU does require data to be tagged by the user to teach it how to predict intents and entities accurately. |
| C[ustom named entity recognition](/o/dG9lU0KHIdHcxa94EY4e/s/P6fNNGB9iCrfE7Zsn3eW/azure-ai-services/language-service/pre-configured-features/named-entity-recognition)                                    | Custom entity recognition takes custom labeled data and extracts specified entities from unstructured text. For example, if you have various contract documents that you want to extract involved parties from, you can train a model to recognize how to predict them.                                                                     |
| [Custom text classification](/o/dG9lU0KHIdHcxa94EY4e/s/P6fNNGB9iCrfE7Zsn3eW/azure-ai-services/language-service/model-based-features-learning/text-classification)                                        | Custom text classification enables users to classify text or documents as custom defined groups. For example, you can train a model to look at news articles and identify the category they should fall into, such as *News* or *Entertainment*.                                                                                            |

The data to answer these questions comes from documents like FAQs or manuals.                                                                                                                                                   |
