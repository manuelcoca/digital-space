## Notes

-   You pay by storage and capacity (compute power)

## Terminology

-   Workspaces using capacity, only one capacity, which has a region. So region of capactiy determines where data is stored
-   Capacities: - Are not covering licence for Power BI, it requires own license - Fabric Capacities are region based and it will determine in which region data will be stored - Create multiple capacities, if you have different data residency, billing or department requirements ![[Screenshot 2024-12-09 at 16.34.03.png]]
