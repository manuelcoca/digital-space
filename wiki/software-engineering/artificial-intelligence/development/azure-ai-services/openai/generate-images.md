## What is DALL-E?

Azure OpenAI Service provides a neural network based model that can generate graphical data from natural language input - called DALL-E.

For every use-case where a desired image can be described:

-   Creation of illustrations
-   Photorealistic images for articles or marketing collateral
-   Generation of unique product images
-   Generation of company logos

## Image generation

Images generated by DALL-E are original; they are not retrieved from a curated image catalog. In other words, DALL-E is not a search system for *finding* appropriate images - it is an artificial intelligence (AI) model that *generates* new images based on the data on which it was trained.

Example: `A squirrel on a motorcycle`

Will probably result in something like this: ![[squirrel-on-a-motorcycle.png]]

### Use DALL-E in Azure OpenAI Studio

When using the playground, you can adjust the **settings** to specify:

-   The number of images to be generated in response to a prompt (the default number of images is one).
-   The resolution (size) of the generated image(s). Available sizes are *256x256*, *512x512*, or *1024x1024* (which is the default value).

## Use DALL-E via REST API

To make a REST call to the service, you need the endpoint and authorization key for the Azure OpenAI Service resource you have provisioned in Azure. You initiate the image generation process by submitting a POST request to the service endpoint with the authorization key in the header. The request must contain the following parameters in a JSON body:

-   **prompt**: The description of the image to be generated.
-   **n**: The number of images to be generated.
-   **size**: The resolution of the image(s) to be generated (_256x256_, *512x512*, or *1024x1024*).

For example, the following JSON could be used to generate an 512 x 512 image of a badger wearing a tuxedo:

```
{
    "prompt": "A badger wearing a tuxedo",
    "n": 1,
    "size": "512x512"
}
```

The result from the initial request does not immediately return the results of the image generation process. Instead, the response includes an **operation-location** header with a URL for a callback service that your application code can poll until the results of image generation are ready.

When the operation has succeeded, a response similar to the following JSON is returned:

```
{
    "created": 1686780744,
    "expires": 1686867152,
    "id": "6d765598-eeee-4f49-885d-03ee1c8f9b02",
    "result": {
        "created": 1686780744,
        "data": [
            {
                "url": "https://dalleproduse.....png"
            }
        ]
    },
    "status": "succeeded"
}
```

The **result** element includes a collection of **url** elements, each of which references a PNG image file generated from the prompt.
