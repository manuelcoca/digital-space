## Factors influencing a bot's success

Ultimately, factors that lead to a successful bot all revolve around creating a great user experience:

-   Discoverability is crucial; users must be able to find the bot for it to be useful.
-   Intuitive and easy-to-use bots are more likely to be used, while frustrating ones are avoided.
-   Availability on preferred devices and platforms is essential for success.
-   Users prefer quick problem-solving with minimal bot interaction.
-   Bots should offer better solutions than alternative methods to be preferred by users.

## Factors that do not guarantee success

-   Prioritizing being the smartest bot may not impress users and can lead to user experience issues.
-   Simplicity is important; complex AI and machine learning features can introduce problems.
-   Natural language features should serve the user's needs; a simple bot can still be successful.
-   Using speech for bot interactions may have challenges, such as language support and accuracy in noisy environments.
-   Voice interaction should only be used when it genuinely enhances the user experience.
-   Focus on the user's problem to solve, nothing more, nothing less
