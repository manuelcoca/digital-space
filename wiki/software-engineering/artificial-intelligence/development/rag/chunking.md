-   **Chunking:** process of breaking down large documents or datasets into smaller, more manageable pieces.
-   **Purpose:** make it easier for the retrieval system to search and identify the specific pieces of information that are most relevant to the input query.
-   **Advantage:** allows the system to locate and retrieve the most relevant parts of the data quickly and accurately.

There are different strategies for chunking documents. The choice of chunking strategy depends on the nature of the data and the requirements:

| Strategy     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | User Case                                                                                                                                                                                             | Example                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fixed Length | Splitting text into chunks of a fixed number of words, sentences, or characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Simple to implement and works well for documents where the structure is consistent, such as legal texts or technical manuals.                                                                         | Splitting a document into chunks of 500 words each.                                                                                                                     |
| Sentence     | Splitting text into individual sentences. Ensures that the chunks are semantically coherent and complete.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Useful for tasks like sentiment analysis, where maintaining the context of a sentence is important.                                                                                                   | A paragraph of five sentences would be split into five separate chunks.                                                                                                 |
| Recursive    | Breaking down text into chunks at multiple levels of granularity. Initially, larger chunks are created (e.g., paragraphs), and then each of these chunks is recursively broken down into smaller chunks (e.g., sentences or phrases). This process can continue until the desired level of detail is achieved. It actually uses simple characters to determine: "\n\n", "\n", ". ", " ", "" | Useful when there is a need to analyze or process text at different levels of detail, such as in hierarchical topic modeling or when generating summaries that require varying levels of granularity. | Starting with a document split into paragraphs, each paragraph might then be split into sentences, and sentences might further be split into phrases or words.          |
| Semantic     | Advanced technique that involves splitting the text into chunks based on semantic content or topics. Algorithms or models like topic modeling or neural networks are used to identify boundaries where the topic or theme changes.                                                                                                                                                          | Ideal for applications like information retrieval or content recommendation, where understanding the topic structure is crucial.                                                                      | In a document discussing different aspects of climate change, each section discussing a particular aspect (like greenhouse gases, sea levels, etc.) would form a chunk. |

### chunking-techniques

-   Chunking can be done by algorithms:
    -   Character count splits
    -   Token count splits (using tokenizers, but not LLMs)
    -   Sentence splits
    -   Paragraph splits
    -   Fixed-size splits with overlap
-   Chunks can be send to embedding models (cheaper) to create embeddings
