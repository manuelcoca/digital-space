## Context Window

The AI context window determines the number of words or tokens that the model looks at when predicting the next word in a sequence. It helps the model understand the context and make more accurate predictions.

Benefits of large context windows:

-   Faster predictions
-   Accepts large inputs
-   Provides detailed analysis
    -   A context window operates to the left and right of the target token to deeply analyze the data
