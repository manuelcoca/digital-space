Every human has the same amount of time. It’s about how we invest our time. **Am I a good time investor?**

1. Say “hell yeah” or “no”— learn to say no.
2. Focus on important, non-urgent tasks (e.g., workouts, learning) to build discipline and reduce stress. Avoid unimportant, urgent tasks by outsourcing or saying no.
3. A longer time horizon improves outcomes; time horizon = goals with deadlines.
4. Productivity is effectiveness (doing the right things) times efficiency (doing things right).
5. Prioritize high-quality time over quantity.
6. Apply the Pareto Principle and skip perfectionism.
7. Address causes, not symptoms.
8. Cluster tasks to minimize context-switching.
9. Divide your work and take regular brakes (e.g 30min work / 5min break).
10. Learn to reset and reflect during breaks.
