My guidance which help me

-   reduce inflammation,
-   decrease insulin resistance,
-   improve lipid profiles,
-   enhance testosterone levels and
-   maintain a healthy skin.

### Nutrition

-   Main focus on animal proteins, vegetables and a bit of fruits
-   Farm-fresh foods
    -   Eggs, meat, dairy and whole vegetables.
-   Low GI (Glycemic Index ) fruits
    -   Are digested and absorbed more slowly.
-   No calorie drinks, no fruit juice
    -   A recipe for poor metabolic health.
-   No refined carbohydrates and harmful fats
    -   No bread, pasta, added sugar, fast food etc.
-   No seed oils with high omega-6/3 ratios
    -   Bad for metabolic health. Often added to packaged food.
-   Healthy fat intake
    -   Increases HDL (good cholesterol) for cardiovascular health. Eggs, nuts, avocados and certain meats.
-   Anti-inflammatory foods
    -   Superfoods such as garlic, ginger, turmeric, and green tea.
-   Interval fasting
    -   8-hour eating window followed by a 16-hour fast. Helps improving insulin sensitivity and metabolic function.
-   Meal portion control
    -   80% saturation rather than full, especially in the evening.
-   Hydration
    -   2-3 l/day. Water supports detoxification processes and combat inflammation.

### Lifestyle

-   Sun Exposure
    -   Can reduce insulin resistance and positively impact overall health.
-   Regular exercise to build muscle mass and reduce weight
    -   Reduces insulin sensitivity and boosts energy
    -   More muscles = more insulin sensitive
-   Regular movement, ideally before or after meals
-   Avoid stress at any cost
-   Understanding thoughts
    -   1h of watching and understanding my thoughts.
-   Sauna 2x per week
-   Quality sleep
    -   7:30h sleep.
    -   Dark and cool environment (16-20°C).
    -   No screen time 1h before bed.
    -   Sleep in 1:30h cycles.

### Body monitoring

1. **Blood Test for Cardiovascular Health + ALT**:
    1. **Lipoprotein:** Genetic marker. High value = increased CVD risk (thrombosis etc.).
    2. **Apolipoprotein**: ApoB carries substances (i.e. "bad" lipids) in blood that help make plaque. Ideal below 60mg/dL, above +100 mg/dL is dangerous.
    3. **Reactive Protein (CRP)**: Spots inflammation. Goal is less than 1, and ideally a lot lower.
2. **Cardiac CT Angiogram**:
    1. Detects arterial plaque, especially when ApoB is higher.
3. **Metabolic Health Test**
    1. **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test** (2hrs test) to understand how body processes sugar
    2. **Dexcom Test** (30-day monitoring) to see how the body reacts to different foods.
4. **Cancer Screening**:
    1. **Colonoscopy** (often started from age 45)
    2. Whole **Body MRI** Test
    3. **GRAIL Galleri** Test - Early cancer detection via a liquid biopsy which tests for ~50 cancers
5. **Physical Fitness Test**:
    1. **VO2 Max Test**: Shows the maximal oxygen usage during exercise.

### Calorie calculation

##### Formula

BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 x weight in kg) + (4.799 x height in cm) – (5.677 x age)

##### Personal calorie goal (gain weight)

BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 x 72kg) + (4.799 x 180cm) – (5.677 x 25)  BMR = 1775

Lightly active (gym 1-3 days/week) = 1775 _ 1.375 = 2440 kcal Moderately active (gym 3-5 days/week) = 1775 _ 1.55 = 2751 kcal Calorien surplus 100-500 = **min. 2540 kcal - max. 2940kcal**
