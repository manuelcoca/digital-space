## insulin

1. **Insulin** - hormone from pancreas; moves glucose (sugar) from food into cells for energy.
2. **Function** - Insulin keeps blood sugar balanced
3. **How it works** - Food intake -> blood sugar rises -> insuling released -> cells open to intake glucose -> glucose is used for energy or stored for later use
4. **Disfunction** - Not enoug insulin is produced = blood sugar too high = insulin resistance = inflammation
5. **Insulin resistance** - A condition in which cells in the body become less responsive to the effects of insulin -> pancreas try to produces more insulin
6. **Consequences** - abnormal blood lipid levels, high blood pressure, and abdominal obesity.

### lipids

Lipid profiles are a group of blood tests that provide information about the levels of various types of fats (lipids) and lipoproteins in your blood. These tests are essential for cardiovascular health and determining the risk of heart disease.

The main components of a lipid profile typically include:

1. **Total Cholesterol:** Total amount of cholesterol in your blood, including both "good" (HDL) cholesterol and "bad" (LDL) cholesterol.
2. **Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) Cholesterol:** Often referred to as "bad" cholesterol, LDL cholesterol is a type of lipoprotein that carries cholesterol from the liver to the cells in the body.
3. **High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) Cholesterol:** Known as "good" cholesterol, HDL cholesterol helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and transport it back to the liver for excretion.
4. **Triglycerides:** Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood that comes from the food we eat and is also produced by the liver.
5. **Triglyceride to HDL Ratio:** This ratio is calculated by dividing the triglyceride level by the HDL cholesterol level. A higher ratio indicates an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, as it reflects elevated triglycerides and/or decreased HDL cholesterol.

Healthy lipid levels vary depending on individual factors, but in general, desirable levels include:

-   Total cholesterol: <200 mg/dL
-   LDL ("bad"): <100 mg/dL
-   HDL ("good"): >60 mg/dL
-   Triglycerides: <150 mg/dL
-   Triglyceride-to-HDL ratio: <2:1
-   High LDL, triglycerides, or ratio = heart disease risk

### short facts

1. Estimated 80% of all human diseases are mediated by inflammation. Insulin resistance is the main driver for inflammation.
2. Inactivity and obesity are the number 1 associations with insulin resistance
3. You can have insulin resistance without being overweight
4. Exercise and physical activity allow the muscle to pull sugar from your bloodstream and use it for fuel
5. Walking before or after meals, even for just 5 minutes, helps to stabilize blood sugar
6. Muscle is the most metabolically active tissue, the more of it you build, the more insulin sensitive youâ€™ll be, all else being equal
7. Drinking your calories is a recipe for poor metabolic health
8. Heart disease is an inflammatory cascade kicked off by insulin resistance, not cholesterol or meat
9. A diet high in omega 6/omega 3 ratio of fatty acids is linked to increased inflammation and disease
10. Seed oils (canola, safflower, sunflower, soybean etc) have high omega 6/3 ratios and are added to the majority of packaged foods because they are cheap and have a long shelf life
11. Eating more eggs and less toast for breakfast will improve your HDL (good cholesterol) while decreasing harmful triglycerides
12. Sun exposure decreased insulin resistance, insulin levels and triglycerides in a study on diabetics
13. Fasting has shown promising results for glucose control, gut health and improving insulin sensitivity
14. A high triglyceride to HDL ratio is one of the biggest risk factors for increased mortality
15. Resistance training raises HDL and lowers triglycerides and blood sugar
16. Inflammation to blood vessel walls leads to a cascade that can eventually choke off the blood supply resulting in heart attacks and strokes
17. Abdominal fat and insulin resistance results in inflammation to your organs that can eventually result in various cancers
18. Muscle mass lost due to aging greatly affects insulin sensitivity but can be combatted with resistance training
19. Insulin resistance is prevented or reversed by:
    1. Fasting
    2. Lifting weights
    3. Shedding weight
    4. Regular activity (walking)
    5. Reducing processed foods
20. Reversing your insulin resistance will result in:
    1. Improved energy levels
    2. Less cravings for junk food
    3. Improved mental health
    4. Longer, happier life
21. Diets high in protein are inversely correlated with insulin resistance.
22. Chronic sugar in your bloodstream is damaging to the blood vessels, and results in crashes in energy when your body has to respond with a burst of insulin.
