3 in every 5 people die from chronic inflammatory diseases (heart disease, strokes, cancers, Alzheimer and more), and an estimated 80% of all human diseases are mediated by inflammation. Insulin resistance is the main driver for inflammation.

# Insulin

1. **What is Insulin?**
    - Insulin is a hormone made by your pancreas, a gland in your body.
    - It's like a key that helps glucose (sugar) from your food get into your cells to give them energy.
2. **How Does Insulin Work?**
    - When you eat, your blood sugar rises.
    - Your pancreas releases insulin into your bloodstream.
    - Insulin tells your cells to open up and let glucose in, kind of like unlocking a door.
    - Once inside your cells, glucose is either used right away for energy or stored for later use.
3. **What Does Insulin Do?**
    - Helps Lower Blood Sugar: Insulin helps bring down high blood sugar levels by moving glucose from your blood into your cells.
    - Stores Energy: It helps store extra glucose in your muscles and liver as glycogen (stored energy) for when you need it later.
    - Stops Sugar Production: It tells your liver to stop making more sugar when you don't need it.
4. **Why Is Insulin Important?**
    - Keeps Blood Sugar Balanced: Insulin helps keep your blood sugar levels stable, not too high or too low.
    - Provides Energy: It gives your cells the energy they need to work properly.
    - Prevents Damage: Without enough insulin or if your body doesn't use it well (insulin resistance), your blood sugar can stay high, which can lead to health problems like diabetes.
5. **What Happens When Insulin Doesn't Work Properly?**
    - If your body doesn't make enough insulin or if your cells don't respond to it well, your blood sugar can stay high - this is called insulin resistance

## Insulin resistance

Insulin resistance is a condition in which cells in the body become less responsive to the effects of insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas (Bauchspeicheldrüse). When cells become resistant to insulin, they are less able to respond to its signals, leading to impaired glucose uptake and elevated blood sugar levels.

### Mechanism of Insulin Resistance:

1. **Normal Insulin Function:**
    - After a meal, blood sugar levels rise, triggering the release of insulin from the pancreas.
    - Insulin binds to insulin receptors on the surface of cells, signaling them to take up glucose from the bloodstream.
    - Glucose is transported into cells, where it is either metabolized for energy or stored as glycogen (a form of glucose storage) in the liver and muscles.
2. **Insulin Resistance:**
    - In insulin resistance, cells become less responsive to the effects of insulin, leading to decreased glucose uptake.
    - Despite the presence of insulin, cells fail to adequately respond to its signals, resulting in elevated blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia).
    - To compensate for insulin resistance, the pancreas produces more insulin, leading to higher-than-normal insulin levels in the bloodstream (hyperinsulinemia).
3. **Consequences of Insulin Resistance:**
    - Insulin resistance is associated with various metabolic abnormalities, including dyslipidemia (abnormal blood lipid levels), hypertension (high blood pressure), and abdominal obesity.
    - Over time, persistent insulin resistance can lead to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, a chronic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels due to impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance.

### Causes and Risk Factors:

1. **Obesity:** Excess body fat, particularly visceral fat (fat stored around internal organs), is strongly associated with insulin resistance.
2. **Physical Inactivity:** Lack of regular physical activity can contribute to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction.
3. **Genetics:** Genetic factors can predispose individuals to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
4. **Poor Diet:** Diets high in refined carbohydrates, sugars, and saturated fats can contribute to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction.
5. **Age:** Insulin sensitivity tends to decline with age, increasing the risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
6. **Hormonal Imbalances:** Conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and Cushing's syndrome can disrupt hormonal balance and contribute to insulin resistance.

# Lipids

Lipid profiles are a group of blood tests that provide information about the levels of various types of fats (lipids) and lipoproteins in your blood. These tests are essential for assessing cardiovascular health and determining the risk of heart disease.

The main components of a lipid profile typically include:

1. **Total Cholesterol:** This is the total amount of cholesterol in your blood, including both "good" (HDL) cholesterol and "bad" (LDL) cholesterol.
2. **Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) Cholesterol:** Often referred to as "bad" cholesterol, LDL cholesterol is a type of lipoprotein that carries cholesterol from the liver to the cells in the body. High levels of LDL cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in the arteries), heart disease, and stroke.
3. **High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) Cholesterol:** Known as "good" cholesterol, HDL cholesterol helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and transport it back to the liver for excretion. High levels of HDL cholesterol are associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.
4. **Triglycerides:** Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood that comes from the food we eat and is also produced by the liver. Elevated triglyceride levels are associated with an increased risk of heart disease, especially when combined with low HDL cholesterol levels.
5. **Triglyceride to HDL Ratio:** This ratio is calculated by dividing the triglyceride level by the HDL cholesterol level. A higher ratio indicates an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, as it reflects elevated triglycerides and/or decreased HDL cholesterol.

Healthy lipid levels vary depending on individual factors, but in general, desirable levels include:

-   Total cholesterol: Less than 200 mg/dL
-   LDL cholesterol: Less than 100 mg/dL (lower levels are recommended for individuals at higher risk of heart disease)
-   HDL cholesterol: Greater than 60 mg/dL
-   Triglycerides: Less than 150 mg/dL
-   Triglyceride to HDL ratio: Ideally less than 2:1

Maintaining a healthy lipid profile is essential for reducing the risk of heart disease and other cardiovascular complications.

# 43 short facts about Insulin and Lipids

1. Insulin resistance occurs due to poor metabolic health
2. When you eat, your pancreas (Bauchspeicheldrüse) naturally releases insulin to absorb the sugar out of your bloodstream into the muscle, fat and liver cells
3. If sugar levels are chronically elevated, your body, like a drug addict, requires more insulin to have the same effect
4. You can be insulin resistant without any symptoms, since it’s a leading indicator and blood sugar is a lagging indicator
5. Once the pancreas is forced to start putting out more insulin, the body begins the process of dealing with increased inflammation
6. Over 88% of the population are not metabolically healthy based on blood pressure, blood sugar, triglycerides or waist circumference
7. Type II diabetes is really an advanced case of insulin resistance
8. A waist measurement of 40 inches or more for men is linked to insulin resistance which also happens to be the average waist size for men over 25
9. You can have insulin resistance without being overweight
10. Exercise and physical activity allow the muscle to pull sugar from your bloodstream and use it for fuel
11. Walking before or after meals, even for just 5 minutes, helps to stabilize blood sugar
12. Muscle is the most metabolically active tissue, the more of it you build, the more insulin sensitive you’ll be, all else being equal
13. Added sugar and refined grains are the foods most closely linked to insulin resistance
14. Drinking your calories is a recipe for poor metabolic health
15. Heart disease is an inflammatory cascade kicked off by insulin resistance, not cholesterol or meat
16. A diet high in omega 6/omega 3 ratio of fatty acids is linked to increased inflammation and disease
17. Seed oils (canola, safflower, sunflower, soybean etc) have high omega 6/3 ratios and are added to the majority of packaged foods because they are cheap and have a long shelf life
18. Eating more eggs and less toast for breakfast will improve your HDL (good cholesterol) while decreasing harmful triglycerides
19. Sun exposure decreased insulin resistance, insulin levels and triglycerides in a study on diabetics
20. Inactivity and obesity are the number 1 associations with insulin resistance
21. Carbs are not the enemy for everyone but for those with insulin resistance or specifically type II diabetes, reducing carb intake should be a focus until a normal baseline is achieved
22. Fasting has shown promising results for glucose control, gut health and improving insulin sensitivity
23. A high triglyceride to HDL ratio is one of the biggest risk factors for increased mortality (Sterblichkeit)
24. Conversely, a low ratio drastically decreases mortality risk. Triglycerides and HDL are both affected by improving your metabolic health
25. Resistance training raises HDL and lowers triglycerides and blood sugar
26. Inflammation to blood vessel walls leads to a cascade that can eventually choke off the blood supply resulting in heart attacks and strokes
27. Abdominal fat and insulin resistance results in inflammation to your organs that can eventually result in various cancers
28. Muscle mass lost due to aging greatly affects insulin sensitivity but can be combatted with resistance training
29. Studies show strength-trained 70 year olds can have greater quad strength than untrained 30 year olds. Resistance training is the fountain of youth
30. Insulin resistance places you at a higher risk for: Hypertension, Type II diabetes, all-cause mortality, majority of cancers and Alzheimer’s disease
31. Insulin resistance is prevented or reversed by:
    1. Fasting
    2. Lifting weights
    3. Shedding weight
    4. Regular activity (walking)
    5. Reducing processed foods
32. Reversing your insulin resistance will result in:
    1. Improved energy levels
    2. Less cravings for junk food
    3. Improved mental health
    4. Longer, happier life
33. Your children are more likely to have insulin resistance if you do, though this is more due to sharing your lifestyle than your genetics
34. Diets high in protein are inversely correlated with insulin resistance.
35. Refined grains like breads and pastas are quickly broken down into sugar in your bloodstream.
36. Chronic sugar in your bloodstream is damaging to the blood vessels, and results in crashes in energy when your body has to respond with a burst of insulin.
37. Type II diabetes occurs when your pancreas fails to produce enough insulin to manage the sugar, but the damage starts well before the that
38. Cardiologists we’re not important doctors years ago because heart disease is a modern issue caused by factory food and inactivity
39. Reversing even advanced insulin resistance is possible with the right mental fortitude, plan and lifestyle adjustments. But the longer you wait, the more challenging it becomes
40. When in doubt, eat farm foods. Meat, eggs, dairy and whole vegetables.
41. Resistance training helps build and maintain muscle, even in the elderly which is perhaps when it’s needed the most.
42. People with heart disease have more linoleic acid in their fat tissues. Linoleic acid makes up 20-70% of seed oils like soybean, canola, sunflower & corn
43. Exercise is important, but an active lifestyle is just as critical. Walk, bike, chase your kids, take the stairs, pick a 5K race and put it on the calendar as motivation.
