-   Encapsulation = bundles state and methods, hides details.
-   OOP weakenes encapsulation = as soon as objects are shared there is no encapsulation anymore
    -   Encapsulation is achieved by strict hierarchy of objects with a root object coordinating state
    -   Correct OOP = giant abstraction hierarchy = no simplicity and maintainability
    -   Wrong OOP = too many shared objects = no encapsulation anymore
-   Encapsulation in OOP
    -   = functionality across classes/methods
    -   = fails at fine-grained level
    -   = creates shared state issues
    -   = increasing complexity and misleading code structures.
-   SOLID principles, dependency injection, test-driven-development etc., compensate for encapsulationâ€™s failures.
