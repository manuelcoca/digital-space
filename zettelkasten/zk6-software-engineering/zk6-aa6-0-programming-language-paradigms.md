    -   No relationship between data types and functions/behaviour
-   Object-oriented = **data-centered design**
    -   State is seperated in units
-   Imperative = **do modify state**
    -   Mutate state whereever needed, no shared state handling
-   Functional = **don't modify state**
    -   Pure functions with no state, minimising state as much as possible
