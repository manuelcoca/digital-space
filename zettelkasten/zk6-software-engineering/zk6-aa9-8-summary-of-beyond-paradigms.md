-   Encapsulation try to tackle shared state issue
-   Essence of Abstractions, Encapsulation, Polymorphism and Composition is to make code easier to read, use and maintain
-   DI, TDD, SOLID are just principles that try to compensate for the shared state issue, but they don't solve the underlying problem
-   It's about
    -   programming language specific aesthetics and features, that allow us to create easy to read, structurable and maintainable code basis
    -   the only principle to follow is, try avoid whack-a-mole-states

1. object-oriented programming
    1. object communicating
    2. concepts
2. Why do we need the concepts and why the principles fail with the fundamental issue?
    1. We can achieve all the principles without OOP
    2. The main issue it tries to solve is shared state issues
    3. Flaws of OOP
3. Explore other paradigms and how they tackle the problem
    1. Compare code samples with abstraction etc.
4. There is no right and wrong. Good software design is beyond paradigms.
    1. Summary of beyond-paradigms
5. Principles of good software design and how to approach it
6. React Samples
