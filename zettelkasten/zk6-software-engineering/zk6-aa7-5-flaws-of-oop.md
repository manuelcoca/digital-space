###### Content

-   Abstractions, Encapsulation, Polymorphism and Interfaces possible without OO languages
-   OOP fundamentally unsuitable for most problems
-   OOP usually fails to deliver promised simplicity, elegance, or maintainability.
-   OO is NOT modelling the real world -> marketing non-sense.
-   OO is application modelling - often very abstract excess structures with no real world parallels.
-   The advantage of OOP is decoupling = The sending object doesn't know or care how the receiver will respond and which implementation of an interface receives his message.
