-   Classifying languages as functional or not can be fuzzy
-   It's more about the programming languages aesthetics:
    -   elegance
    -   simplicity
    -   flexibility
    -   readability
    -   maintainability
    -   structure
-   With aesthetics comes the ability to build a good design that avoids changes and side-effects and still have a good experience.

==Software design is about managing dependencies to make code easier to understand and change.==
