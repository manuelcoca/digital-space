### About This Hub

This Gitbook repository documents my career as a professional consultant, sharing a detailed roadmap (see below) of my acquired skills and knowledge.

My goal is to help you succeed in your software engineering career, not just by supporting you in building professional projects, but also in shaping your professional persona along the way. &#x20;

### Note

This content is for educational purposes and reflects only my personal notes about my skillset and the technologies I've used. Although you might specialize in different technologies, you can still use this Roadmap to cover general concepts. Due to the fast-paced nature of the tech industry, some information may become outdated. I strive to keep the information current. Always cross-reference with the latest sources.


### Let's learn and build together! 🚀

I'm always open-minded and welcome anyone interested in being part of maintaining this knowledge-hub.
